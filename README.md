# Hats off

I am attempting to write a book in this repository. What I really want, dear reader, is this. On the day when the manuscript reaches the publisher, I want her or him to stand up â€” after they have read it through, of course - and say to their staff: "Ladies and gentlemen, hats off!" The title of the book is work in progress so for now I just use *Hats off*.

## Chapters

[Chapter One - Title placeholder](ChapterOne.md)

## Contributions

The book has to be flawless and I will humbly admit that I frequently struggle with finding the right words. What I am saying is that I will gladly accept any advices and merge requests to further improve the book. Don't be shy, I don't bite.
